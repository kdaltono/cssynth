# cssynth
A very basic sound synthesis program written in C# using the NAudio library. It will create and play a sine wave of the correct frequency from a given MIDI device.

This was written as a test to see how responsive a C# application could be as a basic software synthesizer, so the code is very minimal.

The program will also automatically pick the first MIDI device it finds as the MIDI device it uses, and will display the name of the device it is given.
